## ðŸ–¼ Icons
Provide your own icons in the root folder:  
- `icon-16.png`  
- `icon-48.png`  
- `icon-128.png`  

These will appear in Chromeâ€™s toolbar and extension menu.  
*(Tip: A simple black-and-white favicon works well for minimal design.)*

## âš™ Notes
- All tab data is saved **locally** in your browser.  
- JSON import/export is optional â€” data persists even if you donâ€™t back it up.  
- Popup uses a **fixed width** and a **scrollable grid** to minimize long scrolling.
